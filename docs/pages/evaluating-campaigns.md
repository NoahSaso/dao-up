# Evaluating campaign trustworthiness

DAO Up! does a lot to make sure that backer funds are safe. Though at
the end of the day, technology can't solve all trust issues. When
backing a campaign on DAO Up!, here are some tips for making sure it is
safe.

1. Look at the percentage of governance power being allocated to
   campaign backers. Make sure that backers will have sufficient voting
   power to influence decisions the DAO makes, such as withdraw money.
2. Take a look at the campaign's description and community platforms.
   Make sure the DAO has a well thought-out plan and obvious commitment
   to those plans.
3. Figure out who the campaign's creators are. If they are anonymous,
   make sure their past work seems reputable.

## What is a good percentage of governance power?

When a DAO is created, some governance tokens are distributed to its
members, but most of them are kept in the DAO's treasury for future
distribution. Governance tokens stored in the treasury do not count
towards voting power, so the campaign's voting power is computed
by excluding the DAO's treasury balance.

Note that the majority of DAO's governance tokens are often controlled
by the DAO itself. A low percentage of governance tokens does not mean
that backers won't have strong voting power. You can find additional
information about how many tokens the DAO controls by visiting the DAO's
page on DAO DAO and viewing its treasury.
