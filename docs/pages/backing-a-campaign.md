# Backing a campaign

Here we'll walk through the process of backing a campaign on DAO
Up!. By backing a campaign, you can support your favorite projects and
become part of their DAOs.

This guide assumes no prior knowledge about blockchains or Juno. DAO
Up! is for everyone. If you are already familiar with Juno, feel free
to skip to the [backing a campaign](#backing-a-campaign) section.

## Getting set up

### Background

DAO Up! is built on the [Juno](https://junonetwork.io)
blockchain. Juno is a proof of stake blockchain optimized for running
programs. Because it is proof of stake, Juno's fees are low, and it has
less environmental impact than many other popular blockchains.

In order to use DAO Up!, you will need a wallet and some Juno. Your
Juno wallet is similar to the physical wallet you might already be
familiar with. It holds your cryptocurrency and gives you tools for
managing and running programs with it.

We recommend using the [Keplr](https://keplr.app) wallet. It is just a
browser extension. You can go ahead and install it, then come back to
this page.

### A quick rundown of Keplr

Keplr has many features, but the two most important ones are viewing
your balance (the amount of a given cryptocurrency you own) and
viewing your address.

On a blockchain, your address is what identifies you. You can publish
your address and connect it to your real identity or keep it
secret. If you ever want another address, all you need to do is create
another account in Keplr.

Keplr supports many blockchains which are all part of the [Cosmos
network](https://cosmos.network). All you need to know about Cosmos is
that you'll have a different address on each chain.

To view your Juno address, click the puzzle piece icon in the top right
of your browser and then click the Keplr icon. At first, your wallet
will show your balance and address on the "Cosmos Hub". To view your
balance on the Juno network, click the letters which say "Cosmos Hub"
at the top, scroll down to the word "Juno", and click it.

Your address is the circled text underneath your account name which
starts with the letters "juno". Clicking your address will copy it to
your clipboard.

### Getting some Juno

Juno is a young blockchain, so it is not yet listed on any major
exchanges. To buy Juno, you'll need to purchase another cryptocurrency
and then swap that for Juno on a decentralized exchange. Here is one
possible way to do that:

1. Purchase Atom on a centralized exchange like
   [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com).
2. Withdraw your purchased Atom to your "Cosmos Hub" address.
3. Go to the [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone) decentralized exchange
   and deposit your Atom.
4. Swap your deposited Atom for Juno.
5. Withdraw that Juno to your Juno address.

If you do this, congrats! You now own Juno. You can get started
joining DAOs and interacting with the various programs running on top
of it.

## Backing a campaign

First, pick a campaign to back. You can browse all active campaigns in
the [campaign listing](https://daoup.zone/campaigns).

Once you've found one you like, visit the campaign page, input the
amount of Juno you'd like to contribute to the campaign, and press the
"Support this campaign" button. In exchange for your contribution,
you'll receive some fundraising tokens. Here's how those work:

1. When you contribute to the campaign, you'll receive a number of
   fundraising tokens proportional to the percentage of the funding
   goal you contributed.
2. At any time before the campaign completes, you can return those
   fundraising tokens for your money back.
3. Once the campaign is complete, you can return your fundraising
   tokens in exchange for voting (i.e. governance) tokens in the DAO.

Importantly, the DAO will not receive the funds you sent until you
swap your fundraising tokens for governance tokens. This means you
always have control over your money. It also means that you need to
remember to swap your fundraising tokens for governance tokens when
the campaign completes in order to participate in the DAO as well as
ensure the project receives your contribution.

### Getting a refund

At any point before the campaign reaches its funding goal, you can
return your funding tokens for a refund. To do this, visit the
campaign's page, input the percentage or number of tokens you would
like to refund, and press the "Refund" button.

### Participating in DAO governance

Once you have swapped your fundraising tokens for DAO governance
tokens, you can visit the DAO that you're part of by pressing the
"Visit the DAO" button on the campaign's page. To vote in a DAO DAO
DAO, you will need to stake your tokens to the DAO. Make sure to follow
the prompt on the right side of the DAO DAO UI to stake your tokens.
