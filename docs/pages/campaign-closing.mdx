# Closing a campaign

After a campaign is closed the DAO creating the campaign will have its
governance tokens returned and backers will be able to claim refunds.

To close a campaign navigate to your DAOs page on [DAO
DAO](https://daodao.zone) and create a new proposal. Fill in the title
and description of your proposal and then add a custom message to the
proposal with the following contents:

```json
{
  "wasm": {
    "execute": {
      "contract_addr": "<CAMPAIGN ADDRESS>",
      "msg": {
        "close": {}
      },
      "funds": []
    }
  }
}
```

You can find the address of your campaign by looking in the URL bar of
your browser while viewing the campaign. The URL will be in the form
`https://daoup.zone/campaign/<CAMPAIGN ADDRESS>`.

After voting on and executing the proposal the campaign will close and
governance tokens will be returned to the DAO.
