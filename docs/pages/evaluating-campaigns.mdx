# Evaluating campaign trustworthiness

DAO Up! does a lot to make sure that backer funds are safe. At the end
of the day though technology can't solve all trust issues. When
backing a campaign on DAO Up! here are some tips for making sure it is
safe.

1. Look at the percentage of governance power is being allocated to
   campaign backers. Make sure that backers will have sufficient voting
   power to influence decisions the DAO makes.
2. Take a look at the campaign's description. Make sure the DAO has a
   well thought out plan.
3. Figure out who the campaign's creators are. If they are anon make
   sure their past work seems reputable.

Note that the majority of DAO's governance tokens are often controlled
by the DAO itself. A low percentage of governance tokens does not mean
that backers won't have strong voting power. You can find information
about how many tokens the DAO controls by visiting the DAOs page on
DAO DAO and viewing its treasury.
